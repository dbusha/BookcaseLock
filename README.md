# BookcaseLock
I've always been enchanted by the idea of a secret door - a revolving fireplace, a swinging bookcase or a hidden wall panel. When I finally purchased property I knew the first orders of buisness was to build a bookcase door. To keep the door closed I use an Adafruit Trincket to control a solenoid lock. This is the code used to control the solenoid.
