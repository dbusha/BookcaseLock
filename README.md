# BookcaseLock
I've always been enchanted by the idea of a secret door - a revolving fireplace, a swinging bookcase or a hidden wall panel. When I finally purchased property I knew the first orders of buisness was to build a bookcase door. To keep the door closed I use an [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) [Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1500) to control a solenoid lock. This is the code used to control the solenoid.

CMake toolchain is taken from the [CMake-Arduino-NG project](https://github.com/arduino-cmake/Arduino-CMake-NG)
